Abomination,fAbomination-BP,mAbomination-BP,Wounds inflicted by Abominations can’t be prevented by Armour rolls.,5,1,3,5,1,Black Plague,Abomination,Haven’t seen an Abomination yet? Count yourself lucky  neighbour. You’ll recognise one as soon as you see it. Weapons don’t work. Armour don’t work. Running… well  it might work if you’re really fast. But these are relentless. Fire is what you need. A good hot fire. It’s the only thing that works.
Wolfbomination,fWolfbomination,mWolfbomination,Wounds inflicted by Abominations can’t be prevented by Armour rolls.,5,3,3,5,1,Wulfsburg,Abomination,The Big Bad Wolf exists  and it is a bloodthirsty nightmare. We don’t know yet how the Wolfbominations are created  if they are just alpha males turned zombies or the result of hideous experiments  but there is one thing for sure: if you see one  keep away from it for as long as you can. And save dragon bile for them  whatever comes for you first.
Orc Abomination,fOrc-Abomination,mOrc-Abomination,• Wounds inflicted by Abominations can’t be prevented by Armour rolls.,5,1,3,5,3,Green Horde,Abomination,We are not yet certain of the Orc Abomination’s origin  but we know what defines it best: raw power. It is strong enough to rip an armoured soldier apart in a moment’s notice and impervious to anything but extreme damage. Spot them as early as you can in the wandering Orcish hordes  then plan two things: a way to destroy them and an escape route.
Tainted Abomination,fTainted-Abomination,mTainted-Abomination,• Wounds inflicted by Abominations can’t be prevented by Armour rolls.||• When killed  Survivors within the same Zone as Tainted Abomination is dealt 3 damage (preventable by armour).• ,5,1,3,5,1,Friends and Foes,Abomination,Tainted Abominations are even more corrupted and hateful than the normal breed of Abominations. This shows on their infection as putrid and spiky growths. Upon being destroyed  the Tainted Abominations splutter acid blood and trash around with their infected spikes  so you don't want to be anywhere near these foul creatures on their final death throes. 
Abominotaur,fAbominotaur,mAbominotaur,• Wounds inflicted by Abominations can’t be prevented by Armour rolls.||• Abominotaurs can smash through closed doors and walls when they move to reach their target Zone. Set their target Zone before moving them  ignoring closed doors and walls (but not Vault doors and ramparts). If an Abominotaur has to go through a closed door or wall  first put a “broken wall” token to link its starting and destination Zones  and remove any • • closed door token there can be. The broken wall is considered as an open door  and thus can generate a Zombie spawn in a previously closed building. Actors can now cross the Zones. Then proceed with moving all Zombies (as the Zombies’ route can be redefined by the wall’s destruction).,5,1,3,5,2,Abomination Pack,Abomination,The zombie plague reached the far corners of the world  up to the remote places the monsters of old used to hide from human eyes. And then these nightmares are back  turned into war machines of infected omen. You can run  but you can’t hide: they are faster  kill everyone in a large swipe  and will even smash through walls to get to you. If you had a plan  think again!
Abominatroll,fAbominatroll,mAbominatroll,• Wounds inflicted by Abominations can’t be prevented by Armour rolls.||• Abominatrolls have 3 Actions to spend whenever they activate while having a Line Of Sight on a Survivor (or more). After all Zombies have gone through their Activation step and resolved their first Action (including Runners and Abominatrolls)  the Abominatroll goes through the Activation step again  using its second Action to Attack a Survivor in their Zone or • • Move if there is nobody to Attack. Then the Abominatroll goes through the Activation step for a third time  using its third Action to attack a Survivor in their Zone or Move if there is nobody to attack.,5,1,3,5,1,Abomination Pack,Abomination,The zombie plague reached the far corners of the world  up to the remote places the monsters of old used to hide from human eyes. And then these nightmares are back  turned into war machines of infected omen. You can run  but you can’t hide: they are faster  kill everyone in a large swipe  and will even smash through walls to get to you. If you had a plan  think again!
Ablobination,fAblobination,mAblobination,• Wounds inflicted by Abominations can’t be prevented by Armour rolls.||• Ablobinations Attack whenever they activate while having a Line Of Sight on a Survivor (or more) at Range 0-1. Then  they perform an Attack on Survivors in ALL Zones at Range 0-1 on which they have a Line of Sight. Obstacles preventing Movement between Zones (such as ramparts) also prevent such an Attack.,5,1,3,5,1,Abomination Pack,Abomination,The zombie plague reached the far corners of the world  up to the remote places the monsters of old used to hide from human eyes. And then these nightmares are back  turned into war machines of infected omen. You can run  but you can’t hide: they are faster  kill everyone in a large swipe  and will even smash through walls to get to you. If you had a plan  think again!
Swamp Troll,fSwamp-Troll,mSwamp-Troll,• Wounds inflicted by Abominations can’t be prevented by Armour rolls.||• When the Swamp Troll spawns  it will spawn in the Watering Hole closest to a Survivor,5,1,3,5,1,Rat King & Swamp Troll,Abomination,This cunning abomination lurks in the deep waters of the map  waiting to surprise any weary Survivor who happens upon its nest. 
Doom and Gloom,fDoom,mDoom,• Wounds inflicted by Abominations can’t be prevented by Armour rolls.||• Spawns with the necromancer  Lord of Skulls. These brutes follow the Lord of Skulls around  considering his Zone as the noisiest on the board. It is only when they see a Survivor that they will charge them by moving 2 Zones per action  and beating them to a pulp.,5,1,3,5,1,"Special Guest Box: Adrian Smith",Abomination,Orgres are fearsome creatures by nature. But orges turned into undead abominations are truly terrifying. The necromancer known as the Lord of Skulls knew any survivors of the black plague would try to interfere with his rituals  and so he created the perfect bodyguards. He took a pair of the strongest orgres he could find and turned them into abominations. Doom and Gloom  as they are known  retain only enough thought in their shrivelled brains to follow their master anywhere he goes. However  they do tend to charge towards any survivors they see  smashing them to a pulp.
Abominarat,fAbominarat,mAbominarat,• Wounds inflicted by Abominations can’t be prevented by Armour rolls.||• Spawns 1 Zone away from the noisiest Zone on the board  in a Zone with an open passage to it (if several options are available  players choose).,5,1,3,5,1,Kickstarter Exclusive,Abomination,Rats are long-time friends and enemies of mankind. We should have imitated them as they flew in a panicked manner when the zombie plague began  as if they instinctively knew Death was in the air. For a few weeks  we got rid of rats and didn’t have to fear them to steal our food or worse  to bite us. The respite could soon be over  though  as some rats got infected and turned into giant monstrosities. The Abominarats lurk around tunnels  floors and ceilings  laying ambushes to catch the unwary off-guard. I don’t know what scares me the most: their nasty fangs  the nightmarish diseases they carry  or the way they lurk around  remaining unseen despite their size… and stench!
Abominalpha,fAbominalpha,mAbominalpha,• Wounds inflicted by Abominations can’t be prevented by Armour rolls.||• As long as the Abominalpha is on the board  all cards that would spawn Runners  spawn Wolfz instead.,5,1,3,5,1,Kickstarter Exclusive,Abomination,We all heard recurring stories about shapeshifters  outsiders being able to get a human appearance to mingle in the society and execute vile deeds. Whatever the old books and inquisitors said  we all took the lot as a bunch of child stories. People don’t need an excuse to behave like animals  believe me. What we just discovered could prove otherwise. Survivor stories talk about giant wolves running on two legs  and leading entire packs of zombie wolfz against humans. Well  we didn’t believe in werewolves? Whatever! Abominalphas  as we name them  give us the answer to the question we never asked: what would happen if a shapeshifter got infected with the zombie plague?
Werezombie,fWerezombie,mWerezombie,• Wounds inflicted by Abominations can’t be prevented by Armour rolls.||• The Werezombie may act similarly to a standard Abomination at first. However  when it is killed  it turns into another terrifying monster  being replaced by a different Abomination you have available.||• if no Abonmination is available  all Abonimations on the board immediately get an Extra Activation.,5,1,3,5,1,Horde Box,Abomination,||Imagine fighting a desperate battle against a monstrous wolf-like Abomination. After almost dying half a dozen times  you somehow manage to vanquish the beast. Its ruined  deformed body lies motionless on the bloodstained pavement. Only it doesn’t remain motionless for long. Before you can catch your breath  the undead mass starts changing shape  transforming itself into an entirely different kind of Abomination. It opens its evil  bloodshot eyes and charges at you once more! That is the curse of the Werezombie.
Swamp Lurker,fSwampLurker,mSwampLurker,Wounds inflicted by Abominations can’t be prevented by Armour rolls.||The Swamp Lurker is an Abomination that can be particularly tricky to take down. While it is in a Waterhole Zone  it is simply impossible to kill  no matter how strong your weapon (and even if you fire a boulder at it!),5,1,3,5,1,Horde Box,Abomination,Wading into flooded streets in a zombie infested village was never a good idea. People just don’t do well inside a waterhole. They slow us down terribly  and who knows what might be lurking in those murky waters? Well  now we know  and it’s terrifying! The Swamp Lurker is an Abomination that’s in its element in a waterhole. It’s flat out impossible to put this monster down unless you’re able to lure it out of its pestilent waters. And good luck with that!
Horde Brother,fHordeBrother,mHordeBrother,• Wounds inflicted by Abominations can’t be prevented by Armour rolls.||• The Horde Brother makes the looming horde a lot more dangerous. When it spawns  you must place another Abomination from your reserve into the Horde area. When the Horde spawns  it will be led by its own behemoth.,5,1,3,5,1,Horde Box,Abomination,Abominations are bad enough as mindless rampaging nightmares. But to come across one that actually attempts to instill some sense of tactics in its brethren  now that’s a pain in the neck! The monstrosity known as the Horde Brother seems to really appreciate the Orc Zombies’ tendency to amass in a great horde  waiting for the right time to pour over the unsuspecting survivors. How the Horde Brother manages to somehow convince other Abominations to wait around with the Orcs  joining them in the onslaught  is a profound mystery. All we know is it tends to make the green horde twice as terrifying!
Siege Breaker,fSiegeBreaker,mSiegeBreaker,• Wounds inflicted by Abominations can’t be prevented by Armour rolls.||• The Siege Breaker may be a brute  but he's smart enough to have figured out where the true danger comes from  and he's strong enough to do something about it. Instead of going after the Survivors  the Siege Breaker prefers to go after any Siege Engines there might be around. Whether it's a Trebuchet or Ballista  the Siege Breaker will track it down and tear it to splinters if you don't stop it!,5,1,3,5,1,Horde Box,Abomination,Siege engines are great  aren’t they? When Survivors first realized they could use Trebuchets and Ballistae to keep the zombies at bay  it really seemed like overcoming the plague was within our grasp. Of course  the zombies were none too happy about that. Being destroyed in droves before they could even realize what was going on did not sit well with the more pro-active among them.||Enter the Siege Breaker! This Abomination realized the real threat wasn’t the fleshy sacks of blood  but their great wooden contraptions. It has learned to control its hunger long enough to focus its brute energy towards first turning the siege engines into piles of splinters  THEN mauling anybody around them.
The Magenta Covfefe of Aargh,fCovfefe,mCovfefe,• Wounds inflicted by Abominations can’t be prevented by Armour rolls.||• A Survivor with Line of Sight to the Covfefe must spend an extra Action in order to perform a Move Action. This speacial ability doesn't apply if the Survivor stands in the same Zone as the Magenta Covfefe of Aargh.,5,1,3,5,1,Horde Box,Abomination,No one’s really sure what it is  where it came from  or even what it might have been in life. All anyone knows is that this particular undead abomination is powerful  dangerous  and a startling color. Current theory holds that the necromancers discovered any number of horrific creatures kept by the orcs as pets or beasts of burden  and they’ve been experimenting with monstrous results. It’s a particularly successful destroyer thanks to a combination of paralyzing terror and intellectual challenge as people simply can’t believe what they’re seeing and their brains involuntarily work to puzzle it out.
Vault Warden,fVaultWarden,mVaultWarden,• Wounds inflicted by Abominations can’t be prevented by Armour rolls.||• Like all Abominations  the Vault Warden is a pain in the neck for the Survivors. However  this undead beast is the master of hidden places and their secret stashes. Killing the Vault Warden grants the Survivor a random Vault Weapon  so his terrifying sight might not be all bad!||• Upon spawning the Vault varden  set apart all Vault weapon cards you may possess  nad not used for the chosen quest. Shuffle them into a deck and place them face down next to the board.||• A Survivor killing the Vault Warden gets a random Vault weapon card drawn from the deck.,5,1,3,5,1,Horde Box,Abomination,Who said running into an Abomination has to be a bad experience? Sure  the towering Vault Warden is very likely to tear you limb from limb  and the chances of you killing this horned beast are almost nil. But this Abomination has access to secret vaults  and it often finds priceless weapons in them. Lucky for us  it often carries such artifacts with it. Luckier for us  it doesn’t know how to use them. In the unlikely event you come out on top in a confrontation with the Vault Warden  there should be a nice reward waiting for you.
Gorgomination,fGorgomination,mGorgomination,Wounds inflicted by Abominations can’t be prevented by Armour rolls.||The Gorgomination seems to move on a different plane of reality. When it spawns  it is placed directly on the noisiest Zone of the board  if it's a building Zone. Otherwise it spawns in the building Zone closest to it. If that's not terrifying enough  the Gorgomination then ignores obstacles such as walls and closed doors when moving!,5,1,3,5,1,Horde Box,Abomination,The Gorgomination represents a significant achievement for the necromancers engineering the black plague. It is somehow able to walk through walls as if it moved across a different plane of existence. When unleashed  the Gorgomination can and will seek the nearest living flesh and rend it to pieces. Its appetite knows no limits  and its rage knows no bounds. Survivors who have seen the beast have only done so from a distance. Anyone getting too close risks their scent catching its attention. Fortunately  no one has managed to duplicate this brutal beast  as it slew its creators in the initial process.
Abominabunny,fAbominabunny,mAbominabunny,• Wounds inflicted by Abominations can’t be prevented by Armour rolls.||• When Abominabunny attacks  it instantly kills EVERY Survivor in its Zone  no matter their health or how well armoured they may be.||• Only a Dragon Fire effect is able to kill it,5,1,3,5,3,Horde Box,Abomination,“Awwww  look at the little– OH GODS MY FACE!!”||“Beware its grin”  the old tales say of the Abominabunny. While the legendary stalker of the old shire woodlands was always considered a fable  the necromancers herding the green horde seem to have found this lurking menace to man and beast  and made it all the more terrifying. Survivors speak in fearful whispers of the fate of those said to have seen a cute little bunny amidst the carnage. Beware and take care  and mind any vast fields strewn with bones stripped of flesh!
Zombie Giant,fZombieGiant,mZombieGiant,• Armor rolls are allowed.||• Can attack from ranges 0-1.||• All Survivors standing in its target Zone suffer the Attack.||• The Zombie Giant can see and can be seen over buildings and hedges.||• At the start of the Zombies' Phase the Giant will pick up a nearby zombie (giants and Dragons excluded) according to Priority Order and hurl it 2 zones toward the nearest survivor  before that zombie activates.||• The survivor also earns a random Vault Weapon card(if available).,5,1,3,5,1,Horde Box,Abomination,“The plague can infect giants?? How do we even fight that??”||– Distraught survivor||There may be more magic involved in turning giants into zombies than the plague alone  yet this huge  terrifying monstrosity has been sighted more than one  striding across the battlefield and crushing anything in its path (survivor and zombie alike). Living giants tell of an ancient  forgotten time before humankind when their once-thrilling civilization faced a similar crisis. With any luck  “Shaggrant” as he has become known is a singular creation. Alas  the survivors are often rather short on luck.
Chromatiz,fChromatiz,mChromatiz,• Wounds inflicted by Abominations can’t be prevented by Armour rolls.||• At the start of each of Chromatiz's activations  determine how many Actions it has and what Damage it deals during this activation:||• Chromatiz has 3 Actions  but only 2 Actions if any female Survivors are within Line of Sight.||• Chromatiz inflicts Damage 3  but only Damage 2 if any male Survivors are within Line of Sight.||• Familiars don't count,5,3/2,3,5,3/2,Horde Box,Abomination,“Well  now that’s just wrong.”||– Common survivor reaction to Chromatiz||The fabled Chromatic Unicorns from the elven realms were always rather curious creatures. Literally: they’re curious about everything. Strangers to their woods would often find themselves watched from afar  or turn about to spot a unicorn following their trail by scent. Most had little to fear from these beasts  lest they enter the wood with evil intent. Then they’d discover that the unicorns were far from helpless. But now  with the black plague sweeping the world  it seems at least one of these noble beasts has developed an intense curiosity concerning the taste of living flesh!
Deadeye Walkers,fDeadeye,mDeadeye,• Deadeye Walkers attack whenever they activate while having a Line of Sight on one or more Survivors at range 0-3. When attacking they perform a standard zombie attack on the designated zone. If several zones are available  targets are chosen according to these priorities:||• The zone with the most Survivors||• The noisiest zone||• If all eligible zones have the same amount of Survivors & noise  players choose,4,1,1,1,1,Deadeye Walkers,Zombie,he latest trick up the Necromancers' sleeves is a manipulation of the zombie infection that allowed skilled archers to retain their deadly accuracy in zombie form. The experiment rotted their flesh away  but as long they can still hold a bow and arrow  they will serve their sinister purpose to the bitter end. ||The zombie plague strips the infected of everything but their deepest habits  replacing everything else with the urge to kill. The necromancers are obviously trying to turn this to their advantage: playing with infection lead to the creation of Deadeye Walkers  grisly husks of previous bowmen and hunters. The experience rots their flesh away but allows them to keep their skill with bows.
Murder of Crowz,fProdCrowz,mProdCrowz,• May move 3 Zones per Activation||• When moving  they may move up to 3 Zones per Move Action. When moving  they ignore all obstacles. Once they set their target Zone  they fly straight towards it  without splitting or changing direction  and ignoring anything in their way. ,3,1,1,1,1,Murder of Crowz,Zombie,We used to live along with crows  the smartest scavengers you can find in cities and wild alike. Some among us even considered them as useful  in a way  but never told it loud enough for the priests to hear. “Devil’s brood”  they said. The holy men were right: unfortunately  crows were not smart enough to keep from eating infected flesh  and turned into flying pests we now call crowz. The vicious predators find strength in murders  ignoring mundane obstacles to reach their next meal!
Walker,fWalkers-BP,mWalkers-BP,,4,1,1,1,1,Black Plague,Zombie,Once peasants  craftsmen  merchants  or townsfolk  these poor unfortunates were taken unawares. These were everyday people  with their own hopes and dreams  now just zombies all with a singular purpose. We call them Walkers  the dumbest and most numerous of the lot. But never underestimate them. In numbers  they’re very dangerous  and they certainly have numbers.
Spectral Walker,fSpectral-Walkers,mSpectral-Walkers,• Spectral Walkers are similar to standard Walkers  with the distinct difference that they can't be killed by mundane weapons. Normal swords and bows are completely useless against these spectres. If you hope to destroy them  you need to use a Combat Spell  magic Vault weapons or the ever-reliable Dragon Fire!,4,1,1,1,1,No Rest for the Wicked,Zombie,Spectral Walkers are not quite ghosts  though their somewhat ethereal nature can make the bravest knight shake at the knees.
Orc Walker,fOrc-Walker,fOrc-Walker,,4,1,1,1,2,Green Horde,Zombie,Orc Walkers used to be the rank-and file warriors of the Orcish warbands. The zombie plague took their cunning  but none of their strength: each of them is as strong as two grown men. Moreover  there are a lot of them still roaming around fields  houses  and ruins.
Tainted Walkers,fTainted-Walker,mTainted-Walker,• Upon being destroyed  the Tainted Walkers splutter acid blood and trash around with their infected spikes  so you don't want to be anywhere near these foul creatures on their final death throes. 2 Damage,4,1,1,1,2,Friends and Foes,Zombie,Tainted Walkers are zombified Orcs who are even more corrupted and hateful than the normal breed of Orc Zombies. This shows on their infection as putrid and spiky growths.
Swarms of Ratz,fRatz,mRatz,• Swarms of Ratz only deal 1 damage and only take 1 damage to kill  however  these vermin scurry around with remarkable speed. They move 2 zones per activation  ignoring obstacles that prevent movement such as barriers and waterhole ledges  though they cannot cross walls and closed doors. It's hard to feel safe from this plague  though  as every Ratz spawn card also gives an extra activation to all Ratz on the board!,3,1,1,1,1,No Rest for the Wicked,Zombie,From the point of view of many  rats are pests to be killed on first sight. They eat our crops and soil our houses. With a second thought  however  the destinies or rat and man seem linked. Both species are survivors. We accused rats to be responsible for the black plague  the zombie disease  but it seems they carry the burden in the same way we do. They are vulnerable  and can be turned into zombies; we call these the Ratz.||Ratz are as numerous as their brethren  of course  but their fear of man has been replaced with a hunger for human flesh. For an unknown reason so far  they act like a giant pack: as soon as some of them find a fresh food source  all ratz in the vicinity gather for the feast. The more there are  the more frantic these critters become  and you know how agile  how fast a rat can be!
Runner,fRunner-BP,mRunner-BP,,7,2,1,1,1,Black Plague,Zombie,Runners are fast. Faster than anything on two legs should be. I’ve seen ‘em outrun a galloping horse  though only barely. But still  the poor cavalryman didn’t stand a chance.
Orc Runner,fOrc-Runner,mOrc-Runner,,7,2,1,1,1,Green Horde,Zombie,Orc Fatties used to be leaders  shock troops  enforcers and… well  plain brutes. Pay extra attention to them: they are strong  even by Orc standards  meaning they can punch a hole right through your chest. If you have to approach one or go into close-quarters combat in an uncharted building  make sure you wear armor and carry a four-leaf clover.
Fatty,fFatty-BP,mFatty-BP,,5,1,2,1,1,Black Plague,Zombie,Fatties are what we call the… well  fat ones. But there’s more to that blubber than just a dead rich merchant or noble. They ignore pain  just like most dead men. You need a strong arm to finish these. Or a powerful weapon. Or a wizard. Fire works  of course. Use it well to send them to their eternal rest.
Orc Fatty,fOrc-Fatty,mOrc-Fatty,,5,1,2,1,3,Green Horde,Zombie,Orc Fatties used to be leaders  shock troops  enforcers and… well  plain brutes. Pay extra attention to them: they are strong  even by Orc standards  meaning they can punch a hole right through your chest. If you have to approach one or go into close-quarters combat in an uncharted building  make sure you wear armor and carry a four-leaf clover.
Fatty Burster,fFattyBurster,mFattyBurster,• Fatty Bursters are Fatties  but do no benefit from Fatty Extra Activation Zombie cards.||• Drawing a Fatty Burster card first provides an extra Activation to all Fatty Bursters on the board  then spawns a Fatty Burster in the indicated Zone.||• Fatty Bursters don’t Attack. Instead  they explode whenever a Survivor stands in their Zone or ends a Move Action in their Zone. Fatty Bursters also explode upon being eliminated by a Survivor’s Combat or Siege Action.||The explosion inflicts Damage 2 (no Armor roll) to all Actors in the Zone. A Survivor eliminating a Fatty Burster with a Combat or Siege Action earns all experience from additional Zombies eliminated by the ensuing explosion.,5,1,2,1,2,Horde Box,Zombie,"The zombies we call ""Fatty Bursters"" were people struck with potent diseases in their former life. Illness caused a weird change in the zombie plague  turning them into bloated  infected corpses. More than their horrendous complexion  their most surprising feature is unexpected bursts of speed: certainly haunted by former memories  they rush all of a sudden to avoid an invisible and inescapable fate. And when Bursters are close enough  they simply stop trying to keep their corpses together and disintegrate in an explosion of gas  gore and pus. No one wants to die like that!"
Wolfz,fWolfz,mWolfz,• Zombie Wolfz have 3 Actions per Game Turn. After all Zombies (including the Runners and Zombie Wolfz) have gone through their Activation step and resolved their first Action  the Runners and Zombie Wolfz go through the Activation step again  using their second Action to Attack a Survivor in their Zone or Move if there is nobody to Attack. Then the Zombie Wolfz go through the Activation step for a third time  using their third Action to attack a Survivor in their Zone or Move if there is nobody to attack.,7,1,3,1,1,Wulfsburg,Zombie,We now believe the wolves were the first signs of the coming horde. They hunt  certainly  but nothing will draw them like a fresh kill. Scavenging is smart  and numerous wolves can run any lone mountain lion off their kill. When they first encountered the shambling hordes  straggling in like the zombies do  we’re sure the wolves couldn’t resist such easy prey. But  eating that infected meat… well. It changed them.
Feral Dragon,fFeralDragon,mFeralDragon,• The Feral Dragon is immune to all game effects (including Dragon Fire  Enchantments  and Skills)  except Ballistae and weapons matching the type shown by its current Vulnerability card (see step 4 of next chapter).||• The Feral Dragon is a huge beast hovering above the board. Obstacles don’t block Lines Of Sight between Survivors and the Feral Dragon (not even being inside a building).||• Spawning||1- All Zombies standing in the Feral Dragon’s spawning Zone are killed  no matter their type and immunities (like Spectral Walkers  for example). No experience is gained.||2- Roll a die on the Compass card for each Survivor and Siege Engine miniature in the spawning Zone: the target is pushed 1 Zone away in the corresponding direction (this is not a Move). A Survivor or Siege Engine can’t leave the board or cross a wall this way. Instead  it stays in the Zone.||A Survivor still standing in the target Zone suffers 2 Wounds (no Armor roll).||A Siege Engine still standing in the target Zone is destroyed.||3- If the center Zone is a building Zone  set a Rubble card on it. From then on  the Zone blocks Lines Of Sight  cannot be Searched  and cannot be entered (it can be left by a Survivor within  though). According to the Quest’s objectives  this situation can lead to defeat (if a designated Objective was set in the Zone to be taken  for example)!||4- Draw a Vulnerability card. The Feral Dragon can only be hit and wounded by a Ballista  or a weapon matching the type shown on the Vulnerability card you just revealed (and inflicting Damage 2).||• Activation||1- Attack Step: Fire Breath||The Feral Dragon fires at the Zone with the most Survivors within Range 0-1 (if there are any). No Line Of Sight is required  and the fire breath can be done diagonally. If several Zones are eligible  players choose. All Zombies standing in the target Zone are killed  no matter their type and immunities. No experience is gained. Survivors automatically scramble to escape the Dragon Breath unscathed. Roll a die on the Compass card for each Survivor and Siege Engine miniature in the target Zone. It is pushed 1 Zone away in the corresponding direction (this is not a Move). A Survivor or Siege Engine can’t leave the board or cross a wall this way. Instead  it stays in the Zone.||A Survivor still standing in the target Zone suffers 2 Wounds (no Armor roll).||A Siege Engine still standing in the target Zone is destroyed. If the target Zone is a Waterhole Zone  the Dragon doesn’t Attack (it knows fire would be a waste).||2- Move Step: Dragon Stomp||If the Feral Dragon did not Attack during the Attack Step  it Moves after all Zombies. Use standard Move Step rules to define the destination Zone  but move the Feral Dragon 1 tile away in that direction instead. Set it in the center Zone of the next tile. The Feral Dragon can’t enter Vaults and doesn’t Move if all the Survivors are in Vaults.||Upon landing in its target Zone  the Feral Dragon performs a Dragon Stomp. The target Zone and its Actors endure the same effects as a Feral Dragon Spawning. These beasts are flying fast and they hit hard!,2,1,2,1,2,Horde Box,Dragon,What is your opinion on ants? Think about it for a moment. Got it? Dragons mostly think the same about us. Now  what would it||take for you to declare war on ants?||The zombie invasion caused enough trouble to stir dragons away from their business and turn their fiery eyes on us. The legendary creatures are back to restore peace and order  Their peace and order  in the dragon way: destroy  kill  and burn!
Necromantic Dragon,fNecromantic-Dragon,mNecromantic-Dragon,• The Necromantic Dragon is immune to all game effects (including Dragon Fire  Enchantments  and Skills)  except Ballistae and weapons matching the type shown by its current Vulnerability card (see next page).||• The Necromantic Dragon is a huge beast hovering above the board. Obstacles don’t block Lines Of Sight between Survivors and the Necromantic Dragon (not even being inside a building).||• Spawning||1– All Zombies standing in the Necromantic Dragon’s spawning Zone are killed  no matter their type and immunities (like Spectral Walkers  for example). No experience is gained.||2– Roll a die on the Compass card for each Survivor and Siege Engine miniature in the spawning Zone.
